This is a cache simulator project for ECE 521 by Tushar Gupta

Works well with two level of caches. Haven't tested it with more than two levels, will require some modification in 'main' to accomodate extra arguments and in the section which links these arguments to cache parameters. Victim Cache not yet supported
